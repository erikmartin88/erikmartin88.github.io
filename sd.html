			<strong>Exact scores</strong> for site resilience, landscape diversity, and local connectedness are given in z-units where 0 equals the average score and 1 equals one <strong>standard deviation</strong> above (positive) or below (negative) the average.  For example, a low-elevation granite site that scores -2 SD is a site that scores far below all other low-elevation granite sites in its ecoregion indicating it has less landscape diversity and connectedness than other sites of its type. For context, a score of 0.5 SD means the site scores higher than 68% of sites with the same geophysical setting, 1 SD means it scores higher than 89%, and 2 SD means it scores higher than 95%.
